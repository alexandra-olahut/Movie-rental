# Movie-rental
My first Python project done for the Fundamentals of Programming course at Uni

This app stores Movies, Clients and Rentals, performs CRUD operations and provides
- different reports using DTOs
- undo/redo functionality
- working with files (text/binary)

During this first semester course we were introduced to layered architecture, single-responsability-principle, GRASP, etc..
